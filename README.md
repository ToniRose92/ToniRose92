## Introducing Myself 👋

Hey there, I'm a customer support and team leadership pro who's looking to make the jump into the exciting world of data analytics. I'm a total geek when it comes to SQL, Python, and Excel, and I'm always looking for new and interesting ways to apply my skills to solve real-world business problems.

When I'm not poring over data or helping my team level up their customer support game, you can usually find me gaming or tinkering with new tech. I'm a bit of a sci-fi nerd and love anything that involves space or time travel.

I get completely lost in the data and love being able to find patterns and insights that other people might miss. I'm excited to take on more data analytics projects and see where my skills can take me next!
