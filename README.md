## Introducing Myself 👋

Hey there, I'm a data analyst with a love for sci-fi, fantasy, and anime, and a passion for the entertainment industry. When I'm not poring over data or learning new skills, you can usually find me geeking out over my favorite shows and movies. 

I'm driven to use my skills to make a positive impact in the world, particularly in addressing disparities and injustices within the entertainment industry. As a DV advocate and survivor myself, I'm committed to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion in all aspects of my work. 

Check out my GitHub Projects to see some of the entertainment-focused projects I've been working on - I'd love to connect with others who share my passion for data and using it to make a difference!
